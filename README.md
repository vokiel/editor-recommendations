# The Editor Recommendations Project

This project aims to solve a few problems currently faced by both editor developers and implementers who want
to introduce content editing into their systems.

Check the project website for further details:
http://ckeditor.github.io/editor-recommendations/

Although the project was created by the [CKEditor](http://ckeditor.com/) team and is intended to help in CKEditor 5 development, it is being written in an editor-neutral way and other projects can certainly benefit from it, too.

If you care about providing proper tools that will foster creating quality content, you are most welcome to participate!
