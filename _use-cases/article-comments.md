{% capture description %}

It is a common practice that most of the blogs allow their users to comment the published posts. The ability to comment is usually represented by a simple form with a textfield for the comment's content. That textfield allows users to write a comment and add some basic styling to it (e.g. bold, underline) and comment on particular quotes from the text. The ability to include images in the comments is gaining popularity.

{% capture features %}

* [Link]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/link.html)
* [Bold]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/bold.html)
* [Italic]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/italic.html)
* [Strikethrough]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/strikethrough.html)
* [Quote]({{ site.baseurl}}/features/quote.html)
* [Bulleted List]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/bulleted-list.html)
* [Numbered List]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/numbered-list.html)
* Emoticons/Emojis

{% capture notes %}

* It is almost impossible to predict every possible type of an article comment, therefore there is no strict set of elements that will be included in the content.
