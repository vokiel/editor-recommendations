{% endcapture %}

{% capture markup %}

The `<figure>` element MUST be used to represent the **Image** feature as it is the standard way to express self-contained non-textual additional content<sup>[[1](#ref1)]</sup>.

The `<figure>` element SHOULD have a `class` attribute which value is set to `image` to identify that the element is being used for representing image and to allow styling that particular use-case.

The `<img>` element MUST be used to represent the image itself as it is the standard way to express an image in HTML<sup>[[2](#ref2)]</sup>.

The `<img>` element MUST have at least the following attributes:

* The `[src]` attribute with a valid URL pointing to the image<sup>[[3](#ref3)]</sup>.
* The `[alt]` attribute that contains the textual alternative for the image, if any, or is empty, if the image conveys the information that could be derived from its context or caption<sup>[[4](#ref4)]</sup>.

The caption, if it is present, MUST be represented by the `<figcaption>` element<sup>[[5](#ref5)]</sup>.

Example:

```html
<figure class="image">
	<img src="http://c.cksource.com/a/1/img/sample.jpg" alt="Saturn V carrying Apollo 11">
	<figcaption>Figure 1: Beginning of Apollo 11 mission</figcaption>
</figure>
```
