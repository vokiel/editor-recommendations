{% capture description %}

The **Link** feature provides the user with the ability to link some parts of content to other web resources or other parts of the same content. This feature inserts a new link with a specified text or transforms the selected, previously existing text into a link.

{% capture ui %}

 * UI: A feature providing the user with a way to set up properties for the new link, usually represented as a button with the "<i class="fa fa-link" title="Link" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="sr-only">Link</span>" icon that opens a dialog window with form fields to edit the link properties
 * Title: "Link"
 * Keystroke: <kbd>Ctrl+K</kbd>

{% endcapture %}

{% capture markup %}

The `<a>` element MUST be used to represent the **Link** feature as it is the standard way to express links in HTML<sup>[[1](#ref1)]</sup>.

The link element MUST have at least the `[href]` attribute whose value is a valid URL<sup>[[2](#ref2)]</sup>.

The link element MAY have other attributes defined for the HTML `<a>` element, such as `[target]`, `[download]`, `[rel]` or `[hreflang]`<sup>[[1](#ref1)]</sup>.

Example:

```html
<a href="http://ckeditor.com">CKEditor</a> is an online rich text editor.
```

{% endcapture %}

{% capture implementation %}

* In offline text editors, such as Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer, a keystroke for inserting a link is <kbd>Ctrl+K</kbd> and this keystroke is a _de facto_ standard for inserting links. However it should be noted that this keystroke is reserved in web browsers and reassigning it may cause issues with user experience<sup>[[3](#ref3)]</sup>.
